# Plugging into the future: An exploration of electricity consumption patterns project 
# Abstract

Understanding energy consumption patterns is vital in an industry, that of the distribution of electrical energy, which is very much limited by infrastructural capacity.
The electric network, in fact, must be sized by taking into account "worst-case" utilisation scenario: the network cannot collapse if there is a sudden surge in demand.
Serving users during period of peak demand, however, is very expensive and reduces the network capability of absorbing systemic demand variations.

For these reasons, in the last years there has been a big push in understanding the demand patterns of different type of commercial and residential users, to be able to predict when the demand will be higher.
By appropriate pricing, then, the operator can try to shift some of the load from periods of high demand to period of low demand, thereby balancing the load on the network.

Using an open big dataset of hourly measurement of electric consumption over the course of one year, we will try to derive demand patterns which can be used as input for pricing strategies.
The data refers to users in the United States, over the year 2004, and is available on the [OpenEI website](https://openei.org/datasets/dataset/commercial-and-residential-hourly-load-profiles-for-all-tmy3-locations-in-the-united-states).

# Files

The file `Analysis.ipynb` contains the main Jupyter notebook.
A clean version of the OpenEI data is in file `energy-consumption.csv.tar.bz2` (remember to deflate this file before running the notebook).
The script used to clean the data is in `clean-data.rb`.
Timezone data for the cities present in the dataset is kept in `timezone.csv`; this file is used as a cache in the notebook, to avoid calling Google's geolocation API.
